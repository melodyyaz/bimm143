## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
hw <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt", row.names = 1)
head(hw)
```

> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
table(hw$geno)
```

```{r}
aggregate(exp~geno, data = hw, FUN=median)
```

>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(hw) + aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
