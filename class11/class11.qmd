## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

##Identify Genetic Variants of Interest

> Q1: What are those 4 candidate SNPs?

rs 12936231, rs8067378, rs9303277, rs7216389

> Q2: What three genes do these variants overlap or effect?

ZPBP2 \>Q3: What is the location of rs8067378 and what are the different alleles for rs8067378?

A/G, Ancestral:G, MAF:0.43 (G). Chromosome 17;39895095

> Q4: Name at least 3 downstream genes for rs8067378?

zpbp2-201, ccds11353.2, ccds11352.1

## Propoprtion og G?G in a population

read in csv

```{r}
mxl <- read.csv("373531-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378 (2).csv")
head(mxl)
```

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.)
```

> Q5: What proportion of the Mexican Ancestry in Los Angels sample population (MXL) are homozygous for the asthma associated SNP (G\|G)?

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.)/nrow(mxl)*100
```

14.06%

> Q6. Back on the ENSEMBLE page, use the "search for a sample" field above to find the particular sample HG00109. This is a male from the GBR population group. What is the genotype for this sample?

homozygous

> Q7: How many sequences are there in the first file? What is the file size and format of the data? Make sure the format is fastqsanger here!

3863 sequences, 

> Q8: What is the GC content and sequence length of the second fastq file?

53%
> Q9: How about per base sequence quality? Does any base have a mean quality score below 20?

20 is your threshold, no

>Q10: Where are most the accepted hits located?

PSMD3, ORMDL3 
>
Q11: Following Q10, is there any interesting gene around that area?

 no 
> Q12: Cufflinks again produces multiple output files that you can inspect from your right-handside galaxy history. From the "gene expression" output, what is the FPKM for the ORMDL3 gene? What are the other genes with above zero FPKM values?

128189, GSDMB, ZBPB2
