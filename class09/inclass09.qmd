## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
db<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```


>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum_xray <- sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","", db$X.ray) ))
sum_em <- sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","", db$EM) ))
```

How can we make this into a fucntion?

```{r}
#x is a column from a matrix that is specified, in the format : matrix$columntitle
#function substitues comma for an empty string, makes it into a number, and sums the values
sum_comma<- function(x) {
  return(sum(as.numeric( gsub(",","", x) )))
}

```

Now we can answer Q1
```{r}
#for xray
sum_comma(db$X.ray)/sum_comma(db$Total)
#for EM
round(sum_comma(db$EM)/sum_comma(db$Total),2 )
```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}

round(sum_comma(db$Total[1])/sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
>Q6. Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Because the resolution is too low to see all three atoms. You need a sub 1 Angstrom resolution to see them. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308




#Section 3: Workigm with structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perfrom bioinformatics calculations on PDG structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

read an ADK structure
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? HOH, MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 2


Perfrom a predcition of felxibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis)

```{r}
#Perform a flexibility prediction
m <-nma(adk)
plot(m)
```


Write out a "movie" (aka trajectory) if tge motion forr viewing in MOL star
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
